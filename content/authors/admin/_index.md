Hello! I am Jean Louis (a.k.a. JL). I do research on privacy-enhancing technologies for the protection of medical (and genomic) data. My interests lie at the intersection of privacy, distributed systems and machine learning. I strive to turn research ideas into real applications that can improve the way data is used in clinical and research settings. 

Currently, I work as research scientist in medical informatics at the Lausanne University Hospital (Switzerland). I am part of Data Science Group within the Direction of Information Systems and of Precision Medicine Unit.

As expert in medical data protection, I am involved in several national and international initiatives such as the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN), the Data Protection in Personalized Health (DPPH) project and Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). 

In February 2018, I completed my PhD in Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL under the co-supervision of Prof. Jean-Pierre Hubaux and Prof. Amalio Telenti. In my Thesis, I propose new privacy-preserving solutions based on applied cryptography and inference techniques for the protection of genomic data.
